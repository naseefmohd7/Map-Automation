# Map-Automation
This is a simple experimental code to make multiple maps at the same time.


I have a shapefile of Indian States. I made all the state maps in a single set of code.


Python used. (Geopandas and matplotlib).


It takes 10 seconds to prepare Many maps.


Visual Studio or Jupyter Notebook are the platforms I prefer for these codes.

Go to Code file to see the code.

Shapefile attached.
